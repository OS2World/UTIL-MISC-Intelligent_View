Intelligent View
================

- About.

	Files with *.INF filter are usually associated with a program object called
View and located in the Nowhere directory. It's easy to associate this program
object with *.HLP files also. But INF and HLP extensions are not only for the
online OS/2 help files, but also for the Windows installation (INF) and help
(HLP) files and even other applications (TEDIT.HLP, the help file of the OS/2
Tiny EDITor is a plain text file).
	The existing association methods in OS/2 WPS (standard and XWP) decides
which application opens the file looking which defined filter matches. That
means ALL HLP (OS/2 help files, Windows help files and others) and INF (OS/2
INF files, Windows installation files and others) files are opened with View.
But View can only recognize OS/2 files.

	Intelligent View can substitute View in the WPS to solve this little
"problem".

	Intelligent View scans the contents of the file and decides the
application:

	- OS/2 INF files are opened with 'view.exe' (the standard IBM or Aaron
	Lawrence's NewView used as replacement).
	- OS/2 HLP files are opened with 'view.exe' (it's posible that this doesn't
	work in versions of OS/2 previous to Warp 4).
	- Windows INF files are opened with 'e.exe'.
	- Windows HLP files are opened with:
		'pe.exe winhlp32.exe' if ODIN and the Win32 help viewer are present or
		'winhelp.exe', the Win-OS2 help viewer.
	- Unknown files are opened with 'e.exe'.

	You can also use Intelligent View with any file manager.

- Commandline options.

	/V shows the version
	/I installs the program
	/U uninstalls the program
	/S creates a shadow of View in the Desktop
	/? shows the help

- Installation.

	Intelligent View searchs the language files in %ULSPATH% and then in the
"language" subdirectory of the program directory.

	Intelligent View searchs the configuration files ('inview.cfg') in %ETC%,
then in %HOME% and when none of them exist, in the program directory.

	Use the commandline options.

	NOTE: A WarpIN version is not distributed due to a WarpIN 0.1.0 bug
resolving the DEEXECUTE atribute when it has parameters. For example:
	DEEXECUTE="$(1)\inview.exe /U"

	Freeware. (The source code is distributed in a separated archive.)
